## Creating optical maps

### 1. Running remage simulations to get an stp file

The map generation is performed directly with _remage_ (_reboost_ is not involved
in this step). An example macro to showcase the required settings (`map.mac`):

```
/RMG/Processes/OpticalPhysics true
/RMG/Processes/OpticalPhysicsMaxOneWLSPhoton true

/RMG/Geometry/RegisterDetectorsFromGDML Optical

/RMG/Geometry/GDMLDisableOverlapCheck true

/run/initialize

/RMG/Output/NtuplePerDetector false
/RMG/Output/Vertex/StorePrimaryParticleInformation false
/RMG/Output/Vertex/StoreSinglePrecisionEnergy true
/RMG/Output/Vertex/StoreSinglePrecisionPosition true

# confinement in disk around array
/RMG/Generator/Confine Volume

/RMG/Generator/Confinement/SamplingMode IntersectPhysicalWithGeometrical
/RMG/Generator/Confinement/ForceContainmentCheck true

/RMG/Generator/Confinement/Physical/AddVolume lar

/RMG/Generator/Confinement/Geometrical/AddSolid Cylinder
/RMG/Generator/Confinement/Geometrical/CenterPositionX 0 m
/RMG/Generator/Confinement/Geometrical/CenterPositionY 0 m
/RMG/Generator/Confinement/Geometrical/CenterPositionZ 0.69 m
/RMG/Generator/Confinement/Geometrical/Cylinder/InnerRadius 0 m
/RMG/Generator/Confinement/Geometrical/Cylinder/OuterRadius 0.7 m
/RMG/Generator/Confinement/Geometrical/Cylinder/Height 2.4 m

/RMG/Generator/Select GPS
/gps/particle     opticalphoton
/gps/ene/type     Gauss
/gps/ene/mono     9.68 eV # 128nm (VUV) LAr scintillation
/gps/ene/sigma    0.22 eV # gaussian width
/gps/ang/type     iso
# use random polarization (this emits warnings that can be ignored)
#/gps/polarization 1 1 1

/run/beamOn 80000000
```

Run remage with this macro to produce the (flat) output file:

```
$ remage -g l200-geometry.gdml -o map.stp.lh5 --flat-output -- map.mac
```

### 2. Create the map

with a map settings file (`map-settings.yaml`):

```yaml
range_in_m:
  - [-0.7, 0.7]
  - [-0.7, 0.7]
  - [-0.51, 1.89]
bins: [280, 280, 480]
```

```
$ reboost-optical createmap --settings map-settings.yaml --geom l200-geometry.gdml map.stp.lh5 map.map.lh5
```

`createmap` can also work on multiple input files at once. Make sure that enough
memory is available; the map object is _fully_ stored in memory. In this
example: For the 58 hardware channels, the example above would require

```{math}
\text{memory} = 8 \cdot n_x \cdot n_y \cdot n_z \cdot (n_\text{ch} + 4) = 8 \cdot 280 \cdot 280 \cdot 480 \cdot (58 + 4) = 19 \times 10^{9} \, \text{bytes}
```

but peak memory usage might be higher. The input buffer will also use some
memory.

For parallelization, `createmap` supports a `-N <n_cpu>` argument. However, this
cannot be scaled indefinitely. Be aware of the memory configuration of the
compute node used (i.e., performance may suffer when using more processors than
in a NUMA domain). `createmap` internally uses locks to access one _shared
memory_ instance of the to-be-created map. The more CPUs are used for the task,
the more lock contention might happen.

:::{note}

In practice, a specific scheme has been shown to be working for large LEGEND
maps. 16 cores on a NERSC perlmutter node work quite fine to produce a map from
a set of input files. To use more of the available resources, 256 input files
are used for one `createmap` task; up to 16 (typically only 12 to have some
spare memory for the peaks) such tasks are run in parallel. This means a total
of 4096 remage output files can be read in parallel.

The 12-16 output files can then be combined into one with

```
$ reboost-optical mergemap --settings map-settings.yaml map.map*.lh5 final-output-map.lh5
```

## Applying optical maps to physics simulations

### Integration into build-hit

_reboost-optical_ is integrated with the remaining _reboost_ stack. The
map-based production of the optical response is divided into multiple steps:

1. generation of primary emitted photon counts (the same for all detecting
   channels)

   ```{math}
   n_\mathrm{emitted}(E_j) \sim \mathcal{P}(Y\, E_j)
   ```

   This is implemented in the processor
   {func}`reboost.spms.pe.emitted_scintillation_photons`.

2. sampling of the actually detected photons (individually per channel)

   ```{math}
    n_c(E_j) \sim \mathcal{P}\left(
        n_\mathrm{emitted}(E_j)
        \, \cdot\, \ \xi_c(x_j)\, \epsilon_c
    \right)
   ```

   where {math}`\xi_c` is the loaded optical map, and {math}`\epsilon_c` is an
   arbitrary user-supplied scaling factor for the channel {math}`c`.

   This is implemented in the processor
   {func}`reboost.spms.pe.detected_photoelectrons`.

The used statistical model are developed and described in more detail in M.
Huber's master thesis.

An example using all these processors can be seen in the documentation of
{mod}`reboost.build_hit`. Especially note the usage of `pre_operations` and
`detector_mapping` to convert a single input table of type scintillator to
multiple optical output tables.

### Standalone tool `reboost-optical convolve` (deprecated)

:::{important}

This old standalone method is deprecated and will be removed in a future version
of reboost.

:::

If the liquid argon volume is registered as a `Scintillator` detector with uid
1, the optical response can be created with:

```
reboost-optical convolve --material lar --map map.lh5 --edep remage-output.lh5 --edep-lgdo /stp/det001 --output optical-response.lh5
```
